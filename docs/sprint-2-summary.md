## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced API Design
- Better TypeScript type definitions
- Improved error handling
- Realistic processing simulation
- Progress tracking capabilities
- Status polling readiness

### UI/UX Improvements
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Improved visual hierarchy
- Better responsive design
- Enhanced accessibility
- Consistent design language

## Current Application Flow

1. **Upload Step**: Users drag/drop up to 5 pet photos with validation
2. **Style Selection**: Interactive grid to choose from 3 AI styles  
3. **Generation**: Real-time progress tracking with 5 detailed processing steps
4. **Results Gallery**: Interactive display of generated designs and product mockups
   - View generated AI designs with download/share options
   - Select product mockups for purchase with price calculation
   - Option to regenerate with different styles

## Remaining Sprint 2 Tasks

### ðŸ”„ WK-1: Gen Worker on RunPod (8 points)
**Status:** Not Started  
**Dependencies:** 
- RunPod account setup
- Docker containerization
- External API integration
- Queue system implementation

**Notes:** This task requires external service setup and is the most complex remaining item.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete WK-1:** Implement RunPod worker integration
2. **Test the full flow:** End-to-end testing with real AI generation
3. **Polish UI feedback:** Add better loading states and error handling
4. **Prepare for Sprint 3:** Start planning product types and mockup generation

## Technical Debt

- Test runner issues in Windows PowerShell environment
- Need to resolve vitest configuration for proper CI/CD
- Consider splitting complex components into smaller units
- Add proper error boundaries for production readiness

## Metrics

- **Total Components:** 2 major UI components (UploadDropzone, StylePicker)
- **API Endpoints:** 2 (POST /api/generate, GET /api/generate)
- **Test Coverage:** 20+ test cases across unit and integration tests
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time status updates with 5-stage processing
- **File Support:** 3 image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP) with validation

## Demo Ready Features

The application is now demo-ready with:
- Complete upload flow with drag/drop
- Visual style selection
- Realistic processing simulation
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Professional UI with step-by-step guidance

**Ready for Sprint 3:** Core workflow established, ready for commerce integration and advanced features.
