### BE-2: Supabase Schema Migration (2 points) ‚úì
**What was built:**
- Complete database schema with 3 tables (users, designs, orders)
- Custom enum types for statuses
- Row Level Security policies
- Automatic user creation trigger
- Updated_at triggers
- Comprehensive indexes
- Rollback migration

**Files created:**
- `infra/supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- `infra/supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema_rollback.sql`
- `infra/supabase/README.md`

## üéØ Definition of Done Checklist

- ‚úÖ Unit tests cover happy + error paths (>80% coverage achieved)
- ‚úÖ Types pass `tsc --noEmit`
- ‚úÖ ESLint clean
- ‚úÖ Components work in development
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md updated
- ‚úÖ Documentation created

## üîß Current Application State

The application now has:
1. **Working upload flow**: Users can drag/drop or select pet photos
2. **Image validation**: Files are validated for size and dimensions
3. **API integration**: Upload creates a design record via API
4. **Database ready**: Schema is ready to be deployed to Supabase

### Demo Flow:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Upload 1-5 pet photos
3. Click "Continue to Style Selection"
4. Design ID is created and displayed
5. Status is polled after 3 seconds (showing mock processing)

## üìä Sprint 1 Metrics

- **Velocity**: 10 story points completed
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for all new code
- **Components Built**: 1 major (UploadDropzone)
- **API Endpoints**: 2 (POST and GET /api/generate)
- **Database Tables**: 3 (users, designs, orders)

## üöÄ What's Next: Sprint 2

### Priority Tasks:
1. **WK-1: Gen Worker on RunPod** (8 points)
   - Implement RunPod worker for SDXL generation
   - SQS message queue integration
   - S3 upload for generated images

2. **BE-3: Poll Job Status Endpoint** (2 points)
   - Create /api/generate/[jobId] endpoint
   - Real-time status updates
   - WebSocket or polling implementation

3. **FE-2: Style Picker Grid** (3 points)
   - Create style selection UI
   - Metal, Pop Art, Watercolor options
   - Visual previews for each style

### Prerequisites for Sprint 2:
- Set up RunPod account and SDXL endpoint
- Configure AWS S3 bucket
- Set up SQS queue (or alternative like BullMQ)
- Deploy Supabase schema

## üí° Technical Decisions Made

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Used Map for demo purposes, ready to swap with Supabase
2. **FormData API**: Used native FormData for file uploads
3. **UUID Generation**: Using uuid package for unique design IDs
4. **Mock Processing**: Simulated async workflow with setTimeout
5. **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive security from the start

## üêõ Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. Face detection not yet implemented (TODO in UploadDropzone)
2. No real S3 upload yet (mocked in API)
3. No authentication yet (designs not tied to users)
4. Style selection hardcoded to "METAL"
5. No proper error UI (using alerts)

## üìù Notes for Next Sprint

- Consider implementing a proper state management solution (Zustand/Redux)
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Set up Sentry for error tracking
- Add E2E tests for the full upload flow

---

Sprint 1 successfully delivered the foundation for the Pet Merch AI MVP. The upload flow is functional, the API is ready, and the database schema is complete. We're on track for the 6-week timeline!
